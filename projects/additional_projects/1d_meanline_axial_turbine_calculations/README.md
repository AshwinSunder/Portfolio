# 1-D Meanline Design Point Calculation and Loss Calculation for an Axial Turbine Stage

## Abstract
A python code was created to calculate the 1-D Meanline design point calculations for the design and off-design behaviors in an axial turbine stage. The formulae and values  used are taken in accordance with the given parameters and allowable boundaries. An excel workbook was created to plot the stage efficiency for a given range of geometric and flow coefficients. The results obtained were then visualized and analyzed. Results show an increase in efficiency and then a decrease giving us a peak/maximum efficiency.
