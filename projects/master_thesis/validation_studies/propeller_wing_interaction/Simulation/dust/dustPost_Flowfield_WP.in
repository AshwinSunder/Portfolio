! Flowfield visualisations in the thesis created for the simulation folder: J1_07_alpha4_2_xp0_841_yp0_51_zp0_alpha_prop0_blade_angle25_IU_LT
! Any set of wing_prop simulation files can be used. Simply run this folder using the dust_post function from this folder: 'dust_post dustPost_Flowfield_WP.in'
! In this file, 5 different chordwise locations (-0.2, -0.06: Used in thesis; 0.0, 0.18, 0.28: Not used in thesis) have been chosen and the Y-Z plane visualisations have been created.
! Read DUST documentation on how to vary the parameters. Note: start_res cannot be 1 for Pressure, Cp visualisations.
